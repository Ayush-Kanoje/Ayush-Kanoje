<!-- Profile README for Ayush Kanoje -->

<h1 align="center">Hey there 👋, I'm Ayush Kanoje</h1>
<h3 align="center">Welcome to my Infinite Void 🌌</h3>
<h3 align="center">💡 Developer | ☁️ Cloud Security Learner | 🚀 IoT & AI Explorer</h3>

<h4 align="center">
I’m an engineering student and emerging technologist, driven by curiosity and a passion for building secure, scalable systems in the cloud.  
My journey blends hardware intuition with software logic — transforming from an IoT tinkerer into a Cloud Security-focused engineer.  
I’m not just learning tools, I’m learning thinking — how systems connect, scale, and defend themselves.

## 🌍 My Technical Journey

Every project, repo, and late-night debug session is a record of my evolution as an engineer.  
I started with the fundamentals — electronics and C++ — and built my problem-solving foundation through DSA and IoT.  
Gradually, I expanded into web development and automation, learning how to deploy and scale.  
Now, I’m diving deep into the cloud ecosystem, focusing on security, identity, and automation — where reliability and protection meet design.

> My mission: to build systems that are not only functional, but resilient, intelligent, and secure by default.

### 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 Pursuing Electronics & Telecommunication Engineering (ETC)
- 🌩️ Transitioning into Cloud & Cloud Security Engineering
- 💡 Passionate about creating smart IoT systems, cloud-integrated apps, and exploring cyber defense principles
- 🧑‍💻 Currently learning Python, Linux, Firebase, and C++ DSA, expanding into AWS fundamentals + cloud automation
- 🧱 Believer in “Build → Break → Secure → Repeat” — the best way to learn is through iteration
- ⚡ Fun fact: I claim to “never fear errors,” yet sometimes end up debugging at 2 AM with coffee in hand ☕😅

## ☁️ Cloud & Security Focus

> My current professional goal: become a proficient Cloud Security Engineer capable of designing, securing, and automating resilient cloud systems.

### Current Learning Focus
- 🏗️ Cloud Foundations: Linux-CMD, IAM, Networking, Compute, and Storage fundamentals
- 🔐 Cloud Security Essentials: Identity Management, Zero Trust concepts, and Threat Modeling  
- ⚙️ Automation Mindset: Using n8n, GitHub Actions, and scripts to build repeatable, secure workflows  
- 🧩 Architectural Thinking: How distributed systems scale, communicate, and remain resilient

## 🧩 Advanced Concept: Adaptive Learning Feedback Loop (ALFL)

This is my self-developed framework for continuous technical evolution.  
It combines project retrospectives, architecture reviews, and security post-mortems into a structured feedback process.

ALFL Workflow:
Build → Break → Secure → Repeat


Each iteration aims to reduce human friction in learning while improving:
 - Code clarity and performance
 - Architectural security hygiene
 - Reusability of automation pipelines

> 🧠 This loop mirrors how modern SecOps and DevSecOps teams evolve — it’s my personal discipline for engineering growth.
